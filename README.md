# Daddy Does Dinner - Cookbook - Code Institute Milestone Project 04


The brief was to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. The recipes are to be stored in a database which can be filtered by a user on the website using the categories. 
It is a data-driven application, and the target audience is any user but targeted towards stay at home moms and dads.
 
## UX
 
This application is intended for use by all but as a stay at home dad who is busy with study, school runs, extra curricular activities, coming up with dinners for my children that they will eat can be a challenge.
I designed the site so that users can share recipes and rate them accordingly.

User Stories:
- As a single mother, I would like an easy reference for meals so I can organize dinner on the train home.
- As a stay at home dad with limited cooking skilled, I would love to find recipes that are simple and easy to cook for my family.
- As a student away from home for the first time, I am looking for somewhere to get easy recipes.

### Layout

The layout used the [Materialize CSS Parallax template](https://materializecss.com/templates/parallax-template/preview.html) which I modified to suit my own requirements. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 

### Existing Features
The following section describes the front-end features in this project.

1. **Navbar** - Consists of the DADDY DOES DINNER logo which returns the user to the "Home" page of the application. There is also links to the "Recipes", "My Recipes", "Login / Dashboard" and Contact forms. The navbar will appear on all pages.
2. **Home** - The home page consists of 4 sample recipes along with some information on contacting the webmaster and a link to the contact us page of the site.
3. **All Recipes** - Directs the user to the "All Recipes" page which displays **ALL** recipes from **ALL** users which have been entered on the site. The user can then filter or browse through the recipes. The can view more information on each recipe by selectign the "See Recipe" link which delivers the user to the "Recipe Detail" page.
4. **Recipe Detail** - Provides users with the recipe details containg a recipe name, description, image (if available), flavour, meal type, base ingredients, ingredients, instructions, author and date posted.
5. **My Recipes** - Provides the user with the recipes that they have added themselves. The user's recipes can be edited and deleted by using the buttons displayed under the recipes.
6. **Login/Dashboard** - When first selected the user will be prompted to create a username to login to the application so that they can add recipes to the database. Once logged in the user will be presented with their dashboard which provides a count of their recipes, along with 3 data charts depicting the number of base ingredients, meal types and food flavours associated with the recipes which have been added.
7. **Contact** - Delivers the user to the contact page. This page displays a blank form, which allows users to contact the website developers to offer feedback and suggestions (not currently wired up to an email address as this is not a real business). Their are also 4 social media buttons so that the user may interact on social networks. (Links NOT LIVE current social media pages for this project as this is not a real business)
8. **Social Links** - Provides users with links to the website social media pages and also shortcuts to the "All Recipes" & "My Recipes" pages.(Links NOT LIVE current social media pages for this project as this is not a real business).

### Features to Implement
1. **Dat Added** I was unable to get this function to work reliably. It would only produce the date of creation.
1. **Videos** - The ability to attach videos to the recipes so that the users can upload video instructions to the associated recipe.
2. **Blog** - Add a feature to include a blog page so that the company can bring intersting news, updates and stories to users of the applications.
